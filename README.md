# Line-Follower-Robot
This project features a line-following robot built using an Arduino, designed to follow a black line on a white surface. The robot uses five infrared sensors to detect the line's position and adjust its movement accordingly.The core logic of the robot is based on a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control system.
